## Notes

### Docker
NanoServer is a **desktop GUI application** that uses local file dialogs and the host's PHP installation. Running it in Docker is not recommended. For containerized PHP development, use a standard PHP/Apache or PHP-FPM image with docker-compose instead.

### MySQL Support
MySQL support is planned for **v1.4.0**. Currently only SQLite is supported. The roadmap item includes MySQL/MariaDB connections and a phpMyAdmin-style query interface.
